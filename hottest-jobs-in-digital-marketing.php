					<h2>CSL Editorial Wed, 05/20/2020 - 10:00</h2>
					<p>Digital marketing is one competency field that attracts talent from multi-variate backgrounds. From data crunchers to creative editors, each individual can carve a professional identity with a relatable niche for their expertise. Digital marketing is referred to the end-to-end online mechanism of creating prospects, nurturing leads and landing sales, all through digital means. Some of these media types could be owned such as your website, blog, customer database, and landing pages whereas others could be paid for such as ads, public relations, & direct mail. For such a diversity of media, you cannot have a one-size-fits-all professional that is tasked with the responsibility to lead 360-degree campaigns. Therefore, with a combination of both the latest digital marketing trends and the basic marketing needs of businesses, we have the following digital marketing jobs in the industry.</p>

					<h2>SEO/SEM specialist</h2>
					<p>Search Engine Optimization is a high-priority task as it pulls the category of users with interest in your services, onto your website.

Together such website optimization techniques help the website to rank higher.</p>


					<h3>Responsibilities of an SEO/SEM Specialist </h3>

					<ol>
						<li class="inner">Gather insights from on-site traffic with web analytics and coordinate with the development team to optimize website code. </li>
