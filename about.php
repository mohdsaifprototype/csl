                            Early in 2015 we establish an Business consultancy firm with name of “Gayatri Devi Solution (GD Solution)” to aim with web and software development as service and product base. At the startup of GD Solution everything in terms of business and technology
                            adoption was going smooth and in good flow. One of the common issues in the IT Sector, we were also facing which is hiring quality manpower, especially in junior software engineers, after arranging numbers of
                            campus drives at different colleges we were not getting enough skilled and ready to use candidates, first we have tried some institutes with hope of getting trained and skilled candidates but it is the same
                            as just pass-out freshers. Finally we decided to prepare the manpower as we required.</p>
