                    <h2>CSL Editorial Mon, 05/25/2020 - 13:00</h2>
                    <p>Java is a popular and relevant programming language used across the world. Its potential makes it a go-to option for applications and programs. This language can be used by software professionals to design scalable, high-performance applications. Java is a language worth learning and a valuable skill for a programming enthusiast to add to his or her capabilities. By completing a Java certification course, you can attain the skills and practical techniques required to code professionally.
                        To help you understand more about Java, let's understand the significance of this language and how it came to be.</p>
                    <h2>What is the Java language all about?</h2>
                    <p>Java is a leading robust, object-oriented, and secure programming language and platform that lets websites and applications run on a user's device. It is one of the most popular programming languages across the globe. The language is used as a foundation in the development and posting of content on the internet. Java is used widely on desktop devices, as well as mobile phones for running programs.

                    </p>
                    <p>Java was developed by Sun Microsystems (currently the subsidiary of Oracle) in 1995. James Gosling (also known as the father of Java) created the language and named it Oak. Since Oak was already a registered company, James Gosling and his team changed the name to Java. </p>
                    <p>A hardware or software environment where a program can be run is known as a platform. Java has a runtime environment (JRE) and API and is therefore classified as a platform. Let's look at a small example of what a simple Java programming saying "Hello World" looks like:</p>
                    <p>// a small Java program<br>
                        public class HelloWorld {<br>
                        public static void main(String[] args) {<br>

                        System.out.println("Hello World");<br>
                        }<br>
                        }

                    </p>
                    <p>The objective of Java is to write a program once and then run this program on multiple operating systems. The first publicly available version of Java (called Java 1.0) was released in 1995. In 2006, Sun started making Java available under the GNU General Public License (GPL). Over the years, new enhanced versions of Java have been released. The current version is called Java 1.8 (also known as Java 8).</p>

                    <h2>What are the skills needed to become a JAVA developer?</h2>
                    <p>While there exists competition in the market space for basic and advanced Java developers, you can stand out from the crowd with some basic skills. For beginners, knowing basic skills could also help comprehend concepts of advanced Java programming in the future.

                    <ul>
                        <li class="lisize">For students who are beginners:
                            <p>For programming beginners, prior knowledge isn't absolutely necessary for learning Java. However, the syntax in Java is similar to the syntax of the C programming language. Therefore, knowing C language can help beginners get a hold of the Java basic programs quickly.
                                Getting acquainted with object-oriented principles before beginning basic and advanced Java programs can also help in understanding the language. Therefore, having an idea on object-oriented languages such as C++ will also help. <br>
                                If you don't have any programming experience, it can take some time (around four-five days) to understand the basics of software programming. Once you get a grip on how computer programs and software applications work, you can start learning Java from scratch.<br><br>

                                Tip for aspiring Java developers: If you are new to programming, you can go for an introduction course for programming offered by CSL before learning Java. To know more, click here.

                        </li>
                        <li class="lisize">For students well-versed with computer programming:
                            <p>Learn or revise the basic concepts of coding before you begin Java programming. Try grasping the basic concepts that hold up different programming languages and avoid letting some of the new terms put you off. Here are some of the basic concepts:<br>
                                <b>Variables:</b> Variables are the name given to methods of storing information in any program. Calling the variable retrieves the stored information.<br>
                                <b>Control structures:</b> Control structures determine which variables should be used based on existing parameters. For example, If...then...else statements are one of the simplest control structures in different languages which tells the program how to proceed.<br>
                                <b>Data structures:</b> Different ways of storing and accessing data in a computer.<br>
                                <b>Tools: </b>A piece of software that can help you program faster.
                                Syntax: A set of rules that define the grammar of a programming language.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                    <h2>What are the career opportunities for a Java Developer or Java Programmer?</h2>
                    <p>There is an index called as People's Popularity of Programming Language index, which ranks languages according to popularity. According to the searches for tutorials, the index says that languages like Python, JavaScript, R, and Swift are gaining attraction in India. The largest shares are still retained by Java and PHP. A clear trend that can be observed from multiple surveys on the most widely used programming language worldwide is that Java and JavaScript are still relevant and quite popular in the coding world.<br><br>

                        India's $150 billion IT services outsourcing industry is adapting to the changes quickly setting in due to automation and higher adoption of digital technologies. The opportunities and jobs available for Java developers are enormous, and their technical knowledge also holds good value. Professionals skilled in Java can apply for jobs in the IT sector, like enterprise back-end jobs and Android mobile application jobs.<br><br>
                        Here are some of the job roles that are available for a professional with Java skills:

                    <ul>
