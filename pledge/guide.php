                                Coronaviruses refer to the family of viruses that are known to cause respiratory infections in both animals and humans. There are seven coronaviruses that are currently known to affect humans, out of which four are commonly found across the globe and cause mild cold like symptoms only. The remaining three are known to cause severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS caused by MERS-CoV, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome caused by SARS-CoV and finally Coronavirus Disease 2019 caused by SARS-CoV-2.
                                COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus that has never been previously identified in humans. It is zoonotic in nature, which means it can be transmitted from animal to human, and human to human interactions. It was first reported from Wuhan City on 31 December 2019 in China. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea.
                                Around 80% of the infected show only mild symptoms and recover with standard medical attention. Older people and those with an underlying or previous medical condition develop serious symptoms and without medical intervention can prove fatal. Around 14% of the infected become seriously ill and 5% critical as per the studies.
                                The virus has affected more than 100,000 globally and has caused more than 3000 deaths. WHO has given the status of Very High Risk at the Global Level.

                            <p class="sub-tittle">
                                Even though COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease, taking adequate precautions can help prevent you from being infected.
                                The virus spread through small droplets from the nose or mouth of the affected person, when the person sneezes or coughs. These droplets can travel more than 1 meter from the source and might land on objects and surfaces. Other people can catch the virus by touching the surface and then touching their eyes, mouth or nose. The virus can also be caught by inhaling these droplets if the distance between the affected person is less than one meter.

                            <ul>
                                <li>Persons and families should adhere to the following recommendations:-</li>
                            </ul>
                            <br>o Place the person in a well-ventilated single room (i.e . with open windows and an open door)
                            <br><br>o Limit the movement of the person in the house and minimize shared space. Ensure that shared spaces (e.g., kitchen, bathroom) are well ventilated (e.g., keep windows open).
                            <br><br>o Household members should stay in a different room or, if that is not possible. maintain a distance of at least 1 mt from the ill person.
                            <br><br>o Limit the number of caregivers, ideally, assign one person who is in a good health and has no underlying chronic or immuno compromised conditions. Visitors should not be allowed until the person has completely recovered and has no signs and symptoms.
                            <br><br>o Perform hand hygiene after any type of contact with person or their immediate environment. Hand hygiene should also be performed before and after preparing food, before eating, after using the toilets and whenever hands look dirty. If hands are not visibly dirty. an alcohol-based hand rub can be used For visibly dirty hands, use soap and water.
                            <br><br>o When washing hands with soap and water, it is preferable to use
                            disposable paper towels to dry hands. If these are not available. use clean cloth rowels and replace them when they become wet. Disposable paper towels should be disposed off in closed bins only.
                            <br><br>o To contain respiratory secretions, a medical mask should be provided to the person and worn as much as possible. Materials used to cover the mouth and nose should be discarded or cleaned appropriately after use (e.g., wash handkerchiefs using regular soap or detergent and water).
                            <br><br>o Caregivers should wear a tightly fitted medical mask that covers their mouth and nose when in the same room as the person. Masks should not be touched or handled during use If the mask gets wet or dirty from secretions, it must be replaced immediately with a new clean, dry mask. Remove the mask using the appropriate technique — that is, do not touch the front, but instead untie it Discard the mask immediately after use and perform hand hygiene.
                            <br><br>o Avoid direct contact with body fluids, particularly oral or respiratory
                            secretions, and stool. Use disposal gloves and a mask when providing oral or respiratory care and when handling stool, urine. and other waste. Perform hand hygiene before and after removing gloves and mask.

                            <br><br>o Use dedicated linen and eating utensils for the person; these items should
                            be cleaned with soap and water after use and may be re-used instead of being discarded. They should be washed at 60-90 oC with common household detergent, and dry thoroughly. Place contaminated linen into a laundry bag.
                            <br><br>o Clean and disinfect daily surfaces that are frequently touched in the room where the person is being cared for, such as bedside tables. bed frames and other bedroom furniture. Regular household soap or detergent should be used first for cleaning, and then, after rinsing, regular household disinfectant containing 0.5% sodium hypochlorite ( i.e., equivalent to 5000 pm or 1 part bleach 5 to 9 parts water) should be applied.
                            <br><br>o Clean and disinfect bathroom and toilet surfaces at least once daily. Regular household soap or detergent should be used first for cleaning. and then, after rinsing, regular household disinfectant containing 0.5% to 1% sodium hypochlorite should be applied.
                            <br><br>o Avoid other types of exposure to contaminated items from the person's immediate environment (e.g.. do not share toothbrushes, cigarettes. eating utensils, dishes, drinks, towels, washcloths or bed linen).
