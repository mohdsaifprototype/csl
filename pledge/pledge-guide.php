                                Face masks are not recommended for the general population.

                            <p class="sub-tittle">
                                It is not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on
                                surfaces, but it seems to behave like other coronaviruses.
                                Studies suggest that coronaviruses (including preliminary information
                                on the COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to
                                several days. This may vary under different conditions
                                (e.g. type of surface, temperature or humidity of the environment).

                            <h4>Is there a vaccine, drug or treatment for COVID-19?</h4>
                            <p class="sub-tittle">
                                Not yet. To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent
                                or treat COVID-2019. However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms.
                                People with serious illness should be hospitalized. Most patients recover thanks to supportive care.
                                Possible vaccines and some specific drug treatments are under investigation.
                                They are being tested through clinical trials.
                                WHO is coordinating efforts to develop vaccines and medicines to prevent and treat COVID-19.
