					<h3>2013 - 2015: The Journey Begins…</h3>
					<hr>
					<p style="height:200px;">

						<img class="image1" src="images\banner\about.jpg">
						Early in 2015 we establish an Business consultancy firm with name of “Gayatri Devi Solution (GD Solution)” to aim with web and software development as service and product base. At the startup of GD Solution everything in terms of business and technology adoption was going smooth and in good flow.
						One of the common issues in the IT Sector, we were also facing which is hiring quality manpower, especially in junior software engineers, after arranging numbers of campus drives at different colleges we were not getting enough skilled and ready to use candidates, first we have tried some institutes with hope of getting trained and skilled candidates but it is the same as just pass-out freshers. Finally we decided to prepare the manpower as we required.
					</p>
					<hr>
					<h3>2015 - 2016: Being Ready To Take off</h3>

Actually all the companies are looking for good and skilled employees to hire. But run inhouse training center is not possible to all companies so after knowing about skill and knowledge of CSL candidates many companies are comes to us to hire candidates for them.<br>
