Let's come to the question <b>"How to become Software Engineer?"</b> So, before going to this question another two questions come that is <b>Who can be Software Engineer?</b> And What are the eligibility criteria for becoming a good Software Engineer? Therefore, starting from these two basic questions which are described below: -

<h2>Who can be Software Engineer?</h2>
	   <p>Without making any exordium of above question I start with the answer.</p>
	   <p>Anybody can become Software Engineer either male or female just he or she would need to have good knowledge of programming languages. As per the law of constitution below 14 years cannot work and it is obvious that for working as Software Engineer one should be above 14 years.</p>
	   
	   <h2>What are the eligibility criteria for becoming a good Software Engineer?</h2>
<p>This is very important question that person should know who is going to choose Software Engineering as career option. So, let's go through the eligibility criteria of any Software Engineer.
